**Spatial Disorder Framework Manipulation**  
(working title)

Basic functionality to deconstruct (metal-organic) frameworks into building blocks, 
manipulate structures and extract finite molecular clusters.

See the notebook for a limited tutorial.

## TODO

**cluster**
- allow option to focus on elements?
- some easy way to define templates

**modify**
- fix dangling bond problem
- modification reorders blocks, 
so that repeated identical function calls (swapping blocks) 
will have a different effect every time..

**tools**
- duplicated code

**tests**
- where are they
